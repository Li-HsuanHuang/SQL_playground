Goal: Return the name of an employee and the name of their boss.
Use column aliases to make the columns employee_name and boss_name.

Note: We obtain different result if on the last line of the query we 
do r1.id = r2.boss_id. However, for this lesson on the website,
the result would be incorrect.

SQL query:

SELECT r1.name AS employee_name, r2.name AS boss_name 
FROM employees AS r1 
INNER JOIN employees AS r2 
ON r1.boss_id = r2.id;
