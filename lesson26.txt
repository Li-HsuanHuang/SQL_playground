Goal: Use left joins to match character names with the actors that play them, 
and use aliases to call the two columns returned character and actor.

SQL query:

select character.name as character, actor.name as actor
from character
left join character_actor 
on character.id = character_actor.character_id
left join actor
on character_actor.actor_id = actor.id;
