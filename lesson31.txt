Goal: Suppose that a fighter's tank could count as a weapon, and it would take precedence over the gun and the sword.
Find each fighter's weapon in that scenario.

The table contains columns name, gun, sword, and tank. 

COALESCE takes a list of columns, and returns the value of the first column that is not null. 
Hence, the value of tank is returned if it's not null.

SQL query:

select name, coalesce(tank,gun, sword) as weapon from fighters;
